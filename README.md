# Sprocket Central Pty Ltd - Analysis Dashboard

## About the Project
The client is happy with the analysis plan and would like us to proceed. After building the model, we need to present our results back to the client. Visualizations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner. A list of customers or algorithm won't cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualizations.

## Task
Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard. Maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is welcome.

## Business Context
It is important to keep in mind the business context when presenting your findings:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's marketing and growth strategy?
- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?

## Target Audience
Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.

## Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, here are the key insights and recommendations:

- From a customer analysis, it was discovered that the most profitable age group was 45–54, with 35–44 and 25–34 following closely behind. The company should prioritize targeting female customers as they made up the majority of their customer base.
- Both car owners and non-owners were equally represented, indicating that the company’s target market is not solely car owners.
- The months of August, July, May, and October were the most profitable, providing the company with an opportunity to attract more customers during these periods.
- Solex, Wearea2B, and Trek bicycles were the top-selling brands, while OHM and Norco Bicycles were the least successful. By focusing on improving the less successful brands, Sprocket Ltd. could potentially increase overall sales.
- The mass customer segment was the most profitable, followed by high net worth and affluent customers.
